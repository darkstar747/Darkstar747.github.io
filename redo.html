<h1>IBS Morning Timing Calculator</h1>

<p class="center">
  <strong>100% Free</strong><br>
  No login, no ads, no data collection
</p>

<p>
A completely free, timing-based tool that helps you see how evening liquids, magnesium, sleep, and nervous system rhythm 
shape your IBS mornings. If your gut feels fine some mornings and like a disaster on others, this is a way to map that pattern.

  Focus on timing, not food lists<br>
  Gut and nervous system pattern explorer
</p>

<h2>How the timing calculator works</h2>

<p>The goal is simple: show you when your evenings are setting you up for either a stable or chaotic morning, so it feels less random.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Enter last night.</strong> You log when you ate dinner or late snacks, when you stopped liquids, when you took magnesium, and when you actually slept and woke up.</li>
  <li><strong>Add context.</strong> You add rough levels for sugar, electrolytes, fiber, stress, and exercise for that day.</li>
  <li><strong>Get a Morning Stability Score.</strong> The tool gives a score from 0 to 100 and a simple breakdown of what helped or hurt your odds of a calm morning, then you log how your gut actually behaved.</li>
</ol>

<p>
You are not being judged. You are just looking at a timing model for IBS and visceral hypersensitivity, instead of guessing every morning.
</p>

<h2>Who this free tool is for</h2>

<ul>
  <li>People whose IBS or visceral hypersensitivity hits hardest in the morning.</li>
  <li>Anyone who wakes up to urgency, loose stool, or cramping that feels random from day to day.</li>
  <li>People who already tried low FODMAP or food elimination and still have unpredictable mornings.</li>
  <li>Folks who notice that late drinking, magnesium timing, or sleep changes their gut, but they cannot see the pattern clearly.</li>
  <li>Anyone willing to keep evening timing consistent for a few weeks to test a theory about rhythm, not restriction.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why timing can matter more than "what you ate"</h3>

<p>
Most IBS advice is a food list. For a lot of sensitive people there is a different problem: the timing and the nervous system.
</p>

<p>
If you have visceral hypersensitivity, your system may not only be reacting to what you ate, but to 
<strong>when</strong> your gut has to move water, magnesium, sugar, and waste through a sensitive colon relative to your sleep and wake cycle.
</p>

<p>
When evenings drift late or stack badly, you compress a lot of gut work into the hours when you are trying to wake up. That is when mornings tend to blow up.
</p>

<h2>Why this tool exists</h2>

<p>
The creator of this tool spent years with IBS, visceral hypersensitivity, and mornings that felt like a coin flip. 
Doctors pressed on the abdomen, suggested fiber and probiotics, maybe mentioned stress, then moved on. 
Nothing explained why some mornings were fine and others were chaos, even on the same foods.
</p>

<p>
Once the pattern was framed as "liquids + magnesium + sleep timing + sensitivity", the mornings finally started to make sense. 
This project is a way to share that timing model for free, so you can see whether your body runs a similar pattern.

<h2>Why are my mornings so unpredictable?</h2>

<p>Here is the short version of what this tool assumes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your gut has its own nervous system that talks tightly with your brain.</li>
  <li>Water, magnesium, and motility ramps through the night shape how full and reactive your colon is by morning.</li>
  <li>Late liquids can push more fluid into the colon closer to wake time, which can mean more urgency for a sensitive system.</li>
  <li>Magnesium glycinate timing can shift when your gut "wants" to move, which can help or hurt depending on the window.</li>
  <li>Inconsistent sleep timing makes it hard for your gut and vagal system to sync up a predictable rhythm.</li>
</ul>

<p>
None of this means your symptoms are in your head. It means a big part of the story is timing and physiology, not just food lists.
</p>

<h3>Example timing pattern</h3>

<p>A typical "bad morning" pattern for a sensitive gut might look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Late liquids: drinking right up until bed, or waking to drink several times.</li>
  <li>Magnesium taken very close to sleep time, instead of a stable 60 to 90 minute window before bed.</li>
  <li>Sleep start drifting later and later, with less than 7 hours in bed.</li>
  <li>Wake time still early, so the gut has less time to settle before you stand up.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For many people with IBS or visceral hypersensitivity, that combination creates an "urgency window" in the first hour or two after waking. 
The calculator turns that window into something you can see instead of just dread.
</p>

<h2>Quick FAQ</h2>

<h3>Is this medical advice or a diagnosis?</h3>
<p>
No. This is a timing model that combines liquids, magnesium, sleep, and sensitivity into a simple stability score. 
It does not diagnose any condition. If your symptoms are severe or feel unsafe, you still need real world medical care.
</p>

<h3>Does this replace diet work or low FODMAP?</h3>
<p>
No. Diet still matters. This tool is mainly for people who have already tried food changes and still wake up to chaos, 
or who strongly suspect that timing is a missing piece in their pattern.
</p>

<h3>Do you collect any of my data?</h3>
<p>
No. The calculator runs in your browser. Your entries are stored on your own device. There are no accounts, no email, and no tracking.
</p>

<h3>How long should I try this?</h3>
<p>
You need at least a few weeks of consistent timing to see a trend. One random good or bad morning does not prove anything. 
The nervous system learns through repetition, not single nights. The goal is to have enough days logged that the pattern is obvious.
</p>

<h2>What this tool is not</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It is not a diagnosis or a medical test.</li>
  <li>It is not a replacement for emergency care or professional treatment.</li>
  <li>It is not tracking you or selling your data.</li>
  <li>It is not a supplement funnel or diet program.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is simply a way to map how timing and rhythm might shape your IBS mornings, so that those ugly days feel less mysterious and less personal.

<h2>Share this free tool</h2>

<p>
If this helps you, it will probably help someone else who thinks they just "have bad mornings" when part of the story is timing and physiology.
You can share the calculator link in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>IBS, gut health, or visceral hypersensitivity communities</li>
  <li>Group chats with friends who also dread mornings</li>
  <li>Posts or stories where you talk honestly about your body</li>

<p>
You are not broken. Your body is running a pattern that almost nobody explains. This tool is just a flashlight on that pattern so you can see it and decide what to do next.
