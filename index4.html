        <p>
          A completely free, biology-based tool that estimates when carbs, sugar, caffeine,
          gut sensitivity and your nervous system might combine to create a spike → crash →
          anxiety window.
          This is not about willpower or personality. It is about timing, hormones, blood
          sugar, gut nerves and how a sensitive nervous system reacts when everything swings at once.
          If you get a strange wave of anxiety one to three hours after eating, this tool
          helps you map that pattern.

      <section class="section-card" aria-labelledby="how-it-works">
        <h2 id="how-it-works">How the timing calculator works</h2>
        <p>
          The goal is simple: show you when a biological wave is likely to hit,
          so it feels less random and less like it came out of nowhere.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Pick the meal or sugar level.</strong>
            In simple mode you choose the plate that looks closest to what you ate.
            In advanced mode you can type approximate grams for carbs, added sugar and caffeine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tell it how sensitive your gut and nerves are.</strong>
            Three quick choices describe how carb heavy your day has been, how reactive your gut is
            and how jumpy your anxiety system feels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>See the spike → crash → anxiety timeline update in real time.</strong>
            The gauge and colored bar show a risk score and the likely spike, crash and recovery
            windows for the next few hours.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          You are not getting labeled. You are just seeing a timing model based on what your body
          tends to do with carbs, sugar, caffeine and sensitivity.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="who-for">
        <h2 id="who-for">Who this free tool is for</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>People who get anxiety or dread one to three hours after eating</li>
          <li>Anyone with IBS or visceral hypersensitivity who feels “wired and tired” after meals</li>
          <li>People who feel a sugar crash but also feel mentally off or on edge</li>
          <li>Folks who notice caffeine plus carbs creates a bigger wave</li>
          <li>Anyone who wants more predictable days, not surprise crashes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why timing matters more than “what you ate”</h3>
        <p>
          Doctors and diet culture focus on the food list. Many sensitive people have a different
          problem: the timing. A higher carb or sugar load often produces a spike in the first hour,
          a drop in the second or third hour and a nervous system flare right on top of that drop.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some people that drop feels like a full anxiety episode. The calculator helps you
          connect that feeling with the biology underneath it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="why-exists">
        <h2 id="why-exists">Why this tool exists</h2>
        <p>
          The creator of this tool spent years dealing with IBS, visceral hypersensitivity and strange
          anxiety spikes that never matched the story in their head. Once the pattern was mapped out
          as “carb load + sugar + caffeine + sensitivity + timing”, the days finally made sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is a way to share that model for free. No signups, no tracking,
          no supplements or courses behind it, just a timing explorer that might give you the
          language to say: “Oh, this is my crash window, not my character.”
        </p>

      <section aria-labelledby="why-feel">
        <h2 id="why-feel">Why am I feeling this way after I eat?</h2>
        <p>
          A lot of people search for that exact sentence and never get a clear answer.
          Here is the short version of what this tool assumes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your gut has its own nervous system that talks tightly with your brain.</li>
          <li>Big carb or sugar loads can cause a sharp rise and then a drop in blood sugar.</li>
          <li>That drop can trigger adrenaline and stress chemistry, which feels like anxiety.</li>
          <li>IBS and visceral hypersensitivity amplify gut signals so they feel louder.</li>
          <li>Caffeine stacks on top of this and can make the wave feel stronger or shakier.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          None of that means your feelings are not real. It means part of the story is timing and
          physiology, not just thoughts.
        </p>

        <h3>Example pattern</h3>
        <p>A big bowl of pasta plus dessert or soda might create:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spike:</strong> 30 to 75 minutes after the meal</li>
          <li><strong>Crash window:</strong> 75 to 150 minutes after the meal</li>
          <li><strong>Recovery trend:</strong> 3 to 5 hours after the meal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you are sensitive, that crash window is often the “why do I suddenly feel so off”
          part of the day. The calculator turns that window into something you can see instead of guess.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="faq">
        <h2 id="faq">Quick FAQ</h2>

        <h3>Is this medical advice or a diagnosis?</h3>
        <p>
          No. This is a timing model that combines carbs, added sugar, caffeine and sensitivity into
          a simple risk score and timeline. It does not diagnose any condition. If your symptoms feel
          severe or unsafe, you still need real-world medical care.
        </p>

        <h3>Does this work if I do not have IBS?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Many people without IBS are still very sensitive to sugar swings or caffeine.
          The visceral sensitivity part of the model just lets you tell the tool how loud your
          body tends to be.
        </p>

        <h3>Why is it free, with no login?</h3>
        <p>
          Because the goal is to give people language for a pattern that is almost never explained.
          You keep your data on your side. There is nothing to sell and no account to create.
        </p>

        <h3>Will this replace my therapist or doctor?</h3>
        <p>
          No. A timing model can sit beside therapy and medical care, not replace it.
          Many people actually find it easier to talk with a clinician once they can say
          “my waves usually hit about two hours after higher carb meals”.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="what-not">
        <h2 id="what-not">What this tool is not</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>It is not a diagnosis or a mental health test.</li>
          <li>It is not a replacement for emergency care or professional treatment.</li>
          <li>It is not tracking you or selling your data.</li>
          <li>It is not a supplement funnel or diet program.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is simply a way to map how carbs, sugar, caffeine and sensitivity might shape your day
          so that waves of anxiety feel less mysterious and less personal.

          If this helps you, it will probably help someone else who thinks they are “just anxious”
          when part of the story is timing and physiology. You can share the calculator link in:

          <li>Group chats with friends who get “food crashes”</li>
          <li>Social stories where you talk honestly about your body</li>

          You are not broken. Your body is running a pattern that most people are never taught to see.
          This tool is just a flashlight on that pattern.
