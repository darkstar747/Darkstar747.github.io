        A completely <strong>free, biology-based tool</strong> that estimates when carbs, sugar,
        caffeine, gut sensitivity, and your nervous system might combine to create a
        <strong>spike → crash → anxiety</strong> window.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not about willpower or personality. It is about timing, hormones, blood sugar,
        gut nerves, and how a sensitive nervous system reacts when everything swings at once.
        If you get a strange wave of anxiety one to three hours after eating, this tool helps
        you map that pattern.

      <h2>How the timing calculator works</h2>
      <p>
        The goal is simple: show you when a biological wave is likely to hit, so it feels less
        random and less like it came out of nowhere.
      </p>

      <ol class="step-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Pick the meal or sugar level.</strong>  
          In simple mode you choose the plate that looks closest to what you ate. In advanced
          mode you can type approximate grams for carbs, added sugar, and caffeine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tell it how sensitive your gut and nerves are.</strong>  
          Three quick choices describe how carb heavy your day has been, how reactive your gut is,
          and how jumpy your anxiety system feels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>See the spike → crash → anxiety timeline update in real time.</strong>  
          The gauge and colored bar show a risk score and the likely spike, crash and recovery
          windows for the next few hours.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        You are not getting labeled. You are just seeing a timing model based on what your body
        tends to do with carbs, sugar, caffeine, and sensitivity.
      </div>
    </section>
        <section class="section-card two-col">
      <div>
        <h2>Who this free tool is for</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>People who get anxiety or dread one to three hours after eating</li>
          <li>Anyone with IBS or visceral hypersensitivity who feels “wired and tired” after meals</li>
          <li>People who feel a sugar crash but also feel mentally off or on edge</li>
          <li>Folks who notice caffeine plus carbs creates a bigger wave</li>
          <li>Anyone who wants more predictable days, not surprise crashes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why timing matters more than “what you ate”</h3>
        <p>
          Doctors and diet culture focus on the food list. Many sensitive people have a
          different problem: the timing. A higher carb or sugar load often produces a
          spike in the first hour, a drop in the second or third hour, and a nervous
          system flare right on top of that drop.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some people that drop feels like a full anxiety episode. The calculator
          helps you connect that feeling with the biology underneath it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Why this tool exists</h2>
        <p>
          The creator of this tool spent years dealing with IBS, visceral
          hypersensitivity, and strange anxiety spikes that never matched the story in
          their head. Once the pattern was mapped out as
          “carb load + sugar + caffeine + sensitivity + timing”, the days finally
          made sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is a way to share that model for free. No signups, no tracking,
          no supplements or courses behind it, just a timing explorer that might give
          you the language to say: “Oh, this is my crash window, not my character.”
        </p>

          <span class="badge">No account required</span>

    </section>

    <section class="section-card">
      <h2>Why am I feeling this way after I eat?</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of people search for that exact sentence and never get a clear answer.
        Here is the short version of what this tool assumes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your gut has its own nervous system that talks tightly with your brain.</li>
        <li>Big carb or sugar loads can cause a sharp rise and then a drop in blood sugar.</li>
        <li>That drop can trigger adrenaline and stress chemistry, which feels like anxiety.</li>
        <li>IBS and visceral hypersensitivity amplify gut signals so they feel louder.</li>
        <li>Caffeine stacks on top of this and can make the wave feel stronger or shakier.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        None of that means your feelings are not real. It means part of the story is
        timing and physiology, not just thoughts.
      </p>

      <h3>Example pattern</h3>
      <p>
        A big bowl of pasta plus dessert or soda might create:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spike: 30 to 75 minutes after the meal</li>
        <li>Crash window: 75 to 150 minutes after the meal</li>
        <li>Recovery trend: 3 to 5 hours after the meal</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you are sensitive, that crash window is often the “why do I suddenly feel so off”
        part of the day. The calculator turns that window into something you can see
        instead of guess.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Quick FAQ</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-q">Is this medical advice or a diagnosis?</div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          No. This is a timing model that combines carbs, added sugar, caffeine and sensitivity
          into a simple risk score and timeline. It does not diagnose any condition. If your
          symptoms feel severe or unsafe, you still need real world medical care.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-q">Does this work if I do not have IBS?</div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          Yes. Many people without IBS are still very sensitive to sugar swings or caffeine.
          The visceral sensitivity part of the model just lets you tell the tool how loud your
          body tends to be.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-q">Why is it free, with no login?</div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          Because the goal is to give people language for a pattern that is almost never
          explained. You keep your data on your side. There is nothing to sell and no account
          to create.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-q">Will this replace my therapist or doctor?</div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          No. A timing model can sit beside therapy and medical care, not replace it. Many
          people actually find it easier to talk with a clinician once they can say
          “my waves usually hit about two hours after higher carb meals”.
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section-card">
      <h2>What this tool is not</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It is not a diagnosis or a mental health test.</li>
        <li>It is not a replacement for emergency care or professional treatment.</li>
        <li>It is not tracking you or selling your data.</li>
        <li>It is not a supplement funnel or diet program.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is simply a way to map how carbs, sugar, caffeine and sensitivity might shape your
        day so that waves of anxiety feel less mysterious and less personal.
