# Carb / Sugar Anxiety Timing Explorer

A completely free physiology-based timing model that shows when carbs, sugar,
caffeine, and sensitivity combine to create a spike → crash → anxiety wave.
Designed for people with IBS, visceral hypersensitivity, post-meal dread, or the
“wired and tired” feeling that hits out of nowhere.

No login, no ads, no tracking, no upsells. All processing happens on the user's
side. This tool exists purely to help people understand their body's timing.

## 🎯 Why this project exists

The creator spent years trying to understand “why do I feel this way 1–3 hours
after eating?” Doctors rarely explain timing models, even though they’re often
the missing link for gut-sensitive or anxiety-sensitive people.

Mapping the pattern as *carb load + sugar + caffeine + sensitivity + timing*
finally made the entire day predictable.  
This project shares that timing model for free so others can see the pattern too.

## ⚠️ Not medical advice

This project does not diagnose any condition and is not a substitute for medical
care. It is an educational timing model meant to help people understand their
own patterns more clearly.

### If this tool helps you  
Share the link with someone who has IBS, sugar crashes, post-meal anxiety, or
the “wired and tired” feeling — it might give them the language they’ve been
missing.
