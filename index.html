    <h1>Why My Mornings Were Hell Until I Fixed My Evening Timing</h1>
    
    <p class="subtitle">A free IBS morning-timing calculator based on years of tracking visceral hypersensitivity, vagus nerve issues, and unpredictable mornings.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>This tool is completely free. No catch. No signup. No data collection.</strong><br>
        I built it for myself, it worked, and I'm sharing it because I know what it feels like to dread the morning.
    </div>

    <p>For years, every morning with IBS was unpredictable. Some days I woke up fine. Other days it was instant digestive chaos the moment my feet hit the floor.</p>

    <p>I did everything the books and forums tell you to do. I eliminated foods. I tracked every bite. I tried gluten-free, dairy-free, low-FODMAP, no-FODMAP, air-and-regret diets.<br>
    Nothing gave me consistency.</p>

    <p><strong>And then it clicked:<br>
    It wasn't what I ate. It was when.</strong></p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>The Pattern I Couldn't See</h2>

    <p>I have visceral hypersensitivity with vagus-nerve amplification. In plain English: my gut and brain "talk too loudly," and the timing of inputs matters more than the exact foods.</p>

    <p>The real problem wasn't breakfast.<br>
    It wasn't the meal the night before.<br>
    It wasn't bread, dairy, vegetables, oils, spices, or any of the usual suspects.</p>

    <p><strong>It was the timing of my evenings.</strong></p>

    <p>After tracking hundreds of days, these were the real predictors of my morning stability:</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>The Evening Timeline That Controls the Morning (for me)</h2>

    <div class="timeline">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Last liquid intake:</strong> stop roughly 6 PM, absolute cutoff around 9:40 PM</li>
            <li><strong>Magnesium glycinate timing:</strong> 60–90 minutes before sleep</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep start time:</strong> consistent window between midnight and 1 AM</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum sleep:</strong> 7 hours, ideally stable</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>When these line up, my mornings are predictable.<br>
    When they don't, things go sideways.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>Why Timing Matters More Than Diet</h2>

    <p>Most IBS advice focuses on food lists and restriction. That helps some people, but there's another group — people like me — where:</p>

    <p><em>the nervous system's timing delay is the real problem.</em></p>

    <p>If you have visceral hypersensitivity, your body may not care much about what you ate.<br>
    But it cares intensely about when your gut is processing water, magnesium, sugar, meals, and sleep cycles.</p>

    <p><strong>Your vagus nerve values timing consistency more than dietary purity.</strong></p>

    <p>This isn't about restriction. It's about rhythm.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <div class="note-box">
        <strong>A Quick Note Before You Try This</strong><br><br>
        This worked for me after years of obsessive tracking.<br>
        Your body may differ.<br>
        This isn't medical advice — it's one person's solution to a problem doctors couldn't solve.
    </div>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>The Calculator I Built (Still Free)</h2>

    <p>After I figured out my timing window, I built a tool to predict my morning stability.</p>

    <p>It calculates a Morning Stability Score (0–100) using:</p>

    <div class="list-section">
        <ul>
            <li>last liquid time</li>
            <li>dinner and snack timing</li>
            <li>magnesium timing</li>
            <li>sleep start and wake time</li>
            <li>sugar intake</li>
            <li>electrolytes</li>
            <li>fiber</li>
            <li>stress</li>
            <li>exercise</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>There's no signup. No email. No tracking.<br>
    Just a tool I wish existed 10 years ago.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>The One-Month Rule</h2>

    <p><strong>This is not a 3-day hack.</strong></p>

    <p>Your vagus nerve needs repetition.<br>
    Your motility needs rhythm.<br>
    Your hypersensitive gut needs predictability.</p>

    <p><strong>Give it one month of consistent timing before you judge it.</strong><br>
    That's when the pattern became undeniable for me.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>Who This Might Help</h2>

    <p>This may be worth trying if:</p>

    <div class="list-section">
        <ul>
            <li>Your IBS mornings are unpredictable</li>
            <li>You get morning urgency, diarrhea, or cramps</li>
            <li>Food elimination didn't fix things</li>
            <li>You sense timing matters but can't map the pattern</li>
            <li>You're willing to follow strict evening timing for 30 days</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>Yes, This Requires Discipline</h2>

    <p>I won't sugarcoat it.</p>

    <p>You may need to:</p>

    <div class="list-section">
        <ul>
            <li>stop drinking liquids hours before bed</li>
            <li>take magnesium at the same nightly time</li>
            <li>keep a consistent sleep schedule</li>
            <li>log the details for a while</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>It's annoying.<br>
    But waking up with chaos is worse.</p>

    <p><strong>This gave me my life back. I wake up stable because my timing is stable.</strong></p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>What to Expect From the Tool</h2>

    <p>It gives you a score.<br>
    Over time, you'll see how your nights shape your mornings.</p>

    <p><strong>For me:</strong></p>

    <p><em>this turned years of unpredictable hell into something I could actually manage.</em></p>

    <p>No guarantees — but if you're dealing with hypersensitivity or IBS unpredictability, this gives you a real pattern to test instead of endless guessing.</p>
