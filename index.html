    <h1>Why My Mornings Were Hell Until I Fixed My Evening Timing</h1>
    
    <p class="subtitle">
        This is a free IBS morning timing calculator based on years of tracking visceral hypersensitivity and nervous system timing. 
        It does not tell you what to eat. It shows how your evenings are setting you up for either a stable or chaotic morning.
    </p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>This tool is completely free. No catch. No signup. No data collection.</strong><br>
        I built it for myself, it worked, and I am sharing it because I know what it feels like to dread the morning. 
        It runs entirely in your browser and your history stays on your own device.
    </div>

    <p>For years, every morning with IBS was unpredictable. Some days I woke up fine. Other days it was instant chaos the moment my feet hit the floor.</p>

    <p>I did everything the books and forums suggest. I eliminated foods. I tracked every bite. I tried gluten free, dairy free, low FODMAP, no FODMAP, and every version of the “maybe it is this food” approach.</p>

    <p><strong>Eventually it clicked.<br>
    The main problem was not what I ate. It was when I did things.</strong></p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>The IBS Morning Pattern I Could Not See</h2>

    <p>I have visceral hypersensitivity with a very reactive gut–brain loop. In plain language, my gut and nervous system are loud, and the timing of inputs matters more than the exact foods most of the time.</p>

    <p>The real problem was not breakfast.<br>
    It was not one specific food group.<br>
    It was not bread, dairy, vegetables, oils, spices, or any of the usual suspects.</p>

    <p><strong>The real driver was the timing of my evenings.</strong></p>

    <p>After tracking hundreds of days, these became the best predictors of my morning stability:</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>The Evening Timeline That Controls the Morning (for me)</h2>

    <div class="timeline">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Last liquid intake:</strong> stop a few hours before bed (for me that is roughly 6 PM, with an absolute cutoff around 9:40 PM)</li>
            <li><strong>Magnesium glycinate timing:</strong> about 60 to 90 minutes before sleep</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep start time:</strong> a consistent window instead of bouncing all over the clock (for me that is between midnight and 1 AM)</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum sleep:</strong> about 7 hours, ideally in a stable pattern</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>When those four things line up, my mornings are predictable.<br>
    When they do not, mornings go sideways.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>Why Timing Can Matter More Than Diet</h2>

    <p>Most IBS advice focuses on food lists and restriction. That helps some people. 
       There is another group, people like me, where:</p>

    <p><em>the nervous system's timing and delay are the real problem.</em></p>

    <p>If you have visceral hypersensitivity, your body may not care as much about one specific food. 
       It cares a lot about when your gut is trying to process water, magnesium, sugar, and meals relative to your sleep cycle.</p>

    <p><strong>Your nervous system values timing consistency more than dietary purity.</strong></p>

    <p>This is not about perfection or restriction. It is about rhythm and repeatable patterns.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <div class="note-box">
        <strong>A Quick Reality Check</strong><br><br>
        This worked for me after years of obsessive tracking.<br>
        Your body is your own.<br>
        This is not medical advice. It is one person’s system for turning a chaotic pattern into something measurable and repeatable.
    </div>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>The IBS Morning Timing Calculator</h2>

    <p>Once I understood my timing window, I built a simple tool to predict my morning stability.</p>

    <p>It calculates a Morning Stability Score from 0 to 100 using:</p>

    <div class="list-section">
        <ul>
            <li>last liquid time</li>
            <li>dinner and snack timing</li>
            <li>magnesium timing</li>
            <li>sleep start and wake time</li>
            <li>sugar intake</li>
            <li>electrolytes</li>
            <li>fiber</li>
            <li>stress</li>
            <li>exercise</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>There is no signup, no email, and no tracking.<br>
    Just a timing model I wish I had ten years ago.</p>

    <h2>The One Month Rule</h2>

    <p><strong>This is not a three day hack.</strong></p>

    <p>Your nervous system learns through repetition.<br>
    Your motility stabilizes with rhythm, not random nights.<br>
    A hypersensitive gut calms down when it can predict what is coming.</p>

    <p><strong>Give it about one month of consistent timing before you judge it.</strong><br>
    That is when the pattern became undeniable for me.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>Who This Might Help</h2>

    <p>This may be worth testing if:</p>

    <div class="list-section">
        <ul>
            <li>Your IBS mornings are unpredictable</li>
            <li>You wake up with urgency, diarrhea, or cramps more often than you would like</li>
            <li>Food elimination did not fully fix things</li>
            <li>You have a gut feeling that timing matters but cannot map the pattern</li>
            <li>You are willing to keep fairly strict evening timing for 30 days</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>Yes, This Requires Discipline</h2>

    <p>I will not pretend this is effortless.</p>

    <p>You may need to:</p>

    <div class="list-section">
        <ul>
            <li>stop drinking liquids hours before bed</li>
            <li>take magnesium at roughly the same time each night</li>
            <li>keep a consistent sleep schedule</li>
            <li>log your inputs for a while</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>It is inconvenient.<br>
    Waking up to daily chaos is worse.</p>

    <p><strong>This gave me my mornings back. When my timing is stable, my gut is quieter and more predictable.</strong></p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>What To Expect From The Tool</h2>

    <p>The calculator gives you a score for each day and lets you build a history. Over time you will see how specific timing changes move that score up or down, and how that lines up with your actual mornings.</p>

    <p>Based on the logic behind it, my rough expectation is:</p>

    <div class="list-section">
        <ul>
            <li>many people who stick with it should see some improvement in predictability and quality of life</li>
            <li>a smaller but still real group may finally feel, “this actually describes how my gut behaves”</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>No guarantees. But if you have hypersensitivity or unpredictable IBS mornings, at least this gives you a concrete pattern to test instead of more guessing.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Can evening timing really affect IBS mornings?</h3>
    <p>For some people, yes. If your nervous system is highly reactive, the timing of fluids, magnesium, sugar, and sleep can matter as much as the foods themselves. This tool is built around that idea.</p>

    <h3>Does this replace a low FODMAP or elimination diet?</h3>
    <p>No. This does not replace medical care or dietary work. It is mainly for people who still have unpredictable mornings even after trying food changes, or for people who already suspect timing is a missing piece.</p>

    <h3>How long does it take to see a pattern?</h3>
    <p>Most people will need at least two to four weeks of consistent timing before a trend becomes clear. One random good or bad morning does not tell you much. The power is in the pattern.</p>

    <h3>Is this medical advice?</h3>
    <p>No. This is one person’s model and experiment, shared so others can test their own timing in a structured way. Always work with a medical professional for diagnosis and treatment decisions.</p>
