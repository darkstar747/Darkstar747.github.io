<h1>IBS Morning Timing Calculator</h1>

<p>100% Free  
No login, no ads, no data collection</p>

<p>
A completely free, timing-based tool that helps you see how evening liquids, magnesium, sleep, and nervous system rhythm 
shape your IBS mornings. If your gut feels fine some mornings and like a disaster on others, this is a way to map that pattern.

Built for IBS and visceral hypersensitivity  
Focus on timing, not food lists  
Gut and nervous system pattern explorer
</p>

<h2>How the timing calculator works</h2>

<p>The goal is simple: show you when your evenings are setting you up for either a stable or chaotic morning, so it feels less random.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Enter last night.</strong> You log when you ate dinner or late snacks, when you stopped liquids, when you took magnesium, and when you actually slept and woke up.</li>
  <li><strong>Add context.</strong> Add your sugar, electrolytes, fiber, stress, and exercise for the day.</li>
  <li><strong>Get a Morning Stability Score.</strong> The tool gives a score from 0 to 100 showing what helped or hurt your odds of a calm morning.</li>
</ol>

<p>You are not being judged; you are just looking at rhythm instead of guessing every morning.</p>

<h2>Who this free tool is for</h2>

<ul>
  <li>People whose IBS or visceral hypersensitivity hits hardest in the morning.</li>
  <li>Anyone who wakes up to urgency, loose stool, or cramping that feels random from day to day.</li>
  <li>Anyone who tried low FODMAP or food elimination and still has unpredictable mornings.</li>
  <li>People who notice late liquids, magnesium timing, or sleep affect their gut but can’t see the pattern.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why timing can matter more than “what you ate”</h3>

<p>
Most IBS advice is a food list. For sensitive people, there is often a different problem: the timing and the nervous system.
</p>

<p>
If you have visceral hypersensitivity, your system may react not just to what you ate, but to 
<strong>when</strong> your gut has to move water, magnesium, sugar, and waste through a sensitive colon relative to your sleep and wake cycle.
</p>

<h2>Why this tool exists</h2>

<p>
The creator of this tool spent years with IBS, visceral hypersensitivity, and chaotic mornings. 
Doctors suggested fiber, probiotics, stress reduction — nothing explained why some mornings were fine and others were chaos.
</p>

<p>
Once the pattern was framed as “liquids + magnesium + sleep timing + sensitivity,” mornings finally made sense. 
This project makes that timing model free for anyone to test.
</p>

<h2>Quick FAQ</h2>

<h3>Is this medical advice?</h3>
<p>No. It is a timing model, not a diagnosis.</p>

<h3>Does this replace diet work?</h3>
<p>No, but it helps people who changed diet and still wake up to chaos.</p>

<h3>Do you collect any of my data?</h3>
<p>No. The tool runs in your browser only.</p>

<h3>How long should I try this?</h3>
<p>Give it a few weeks. The nervous system learns through repetition, not one-night experiments.</p>

<h2>What this tool is not</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Not medical advice</li>
  <li>Not a diagnosis</li>
  <li>Not a supplement funnel</li>
  <li>Not tracking anything you do</li>
</ul>
