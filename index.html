    <h1>Why My Mornings Were Hell Until I Fixed My Evening Timing</h1>
    
    <p class="subtitle">
        This is a free IBS morning timing calculator based on years of tracking visceral hypersensitivity, vagus nerve issues, and unpredictable mornings.
        It does not tell you what to eat; it helps you understand when your evenings are setting you up for a stable or chaotic morning.
    </p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>This tool is completely free. No catch. No signup. No data collection.</strong><br>
        I built it for myself, it worked, and I am sharing it because I know what it feels like to dread the morning. It runs entirely in your browser and your history stays on your own device.
    </div>

    <p>For years, every morning with IBS was unpredictable. Some days I woke up fine. Other days it was instant digestive chaos the moment my feet hit the floor.</p>

    <p>I did everything the books and forums tell you to do. I eliminated foods. I tracked every bite. I tried gluten free, dairy free, low FODMAP, no FODMAP, air and regret diets.<br>
    Nothing gave me consistency.</p>

    <p><strong>And then it clicked:<br>
    It was not what I ate. It was when.</strong></p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>The IBS Morning Pattern I Could Not See</h2>

    <p>I have visceral hypersensitivity with vagus nerve amplification. In plain English: my gut and brain talk too loudly, and the timing of inputs matters more than the exact foods.</p>

    <p>The real problem was not breakfast.<br>
    It was not the meal the night before.<br>
    It was not bread, dairy, vegetables, oils, spices, or any of the usual suspects.</p>

    <p><strong>It was the timing of my evenings.</strong></p>

    <p>After tracking hundreds of days, these were the real predictors of my morning stability:</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>The Evening Timeline That Controls the Morning (for me)</h2>

    <div class="timeline">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Last liquid intake:</strong> stop a few hours before bed (for me that is roughly 6 PM, with an absolute cutoff around 9:40 PM)</li>
            <li><strong>Magnesium glycinate timing:</strong> 60 to 90 minutes before sleep</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep start time:</strong> a consistent window instead of bouncing all over the clock (for me that is between midnight and 1 AM)</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum sleep:</strong> about 7 hours, ideally stable</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>When these line up, my mornings are predictable.<br>
    When they do not, things go sideways.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>Why Timing Matters More Than Diet</h2>

    <p>Most IBS advice focuses on food lists and restriction. That helps some people, but there is another group, people like me, where:</p>

    <p><em>the nervous system's timing and delay are the real problem.</em></p>

    <p>If you have visceral hypersensitivity, your body may not care much about what you ate.<br>
    But it cares intensely about when your gut is processing water, magnesium, sugar, meals, and sleep cycles.</p>

    <p><strong>Your vagus nerve values timing consistency more than dietary purity.</strong></p>

    <p>This is not about restriction. It is about rhythm.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <div class="note-box">
        <strong>A Quick Note Before You Try This</strong><br><br>
        This worked for me after years of obsessive tracking.<br>
        Your body may differ.<br>
        This is not medical advice, it is one person's solution to a problem doctors could not solve.
    </div>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>The IBS Morning Timing Calculator I Built (Still Free)</h2>

    <p>After I figured out my timing window, I built a tool to predict my morning stability.</p>

    <p>It calculates a Morning Stability Score (0 to 100) using:</p>

    <div class="list-section">
        <ul>
            <li>last liquid time</li>
            <li>dinner and snack timing</li>
            <li>magnesium timing</li>
            <li>sleep start and wake time</li>
            <li>sugar intake</li>
            <li>electrolytes</li>
            <li>fiber</li>
            <li>stress</li>
            <li>exercise</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>There is no signup. No email. No tracking.<br>
    Just a tool I wish existed ten years ago.</p>

    <h2>The One Month Rule</h2>

    <p><strong>This is not a three day hack.</strong></p>

    <p>Your vagus nerve needs repetition.<br>
    Your motility needs rhythm.<br>
    Your hypersensitive gut needs predictability.</p>

    <p><strong>Give it one month of consistent timing before you judge it.</strong><br>
    That is when the pattern became undeniable for me.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>Who This Might Help</h2>

    <p>This may be worth trying if:</p>

    <div class="list-section">
        <ul>
            <li>Your IBS mornings are unpredictable</li>
            <li>You get morning urgency, diarrhea, or cramps</li>
            <li>Food elimination did not fix things</li>
            <li>You sense timing matters but cannot map the pattern</li>
            <li>You are willing to follow strict evening timing for 30 days</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>Yes, This Requires Discipline</h2>

    <p>I will not sugarcoat it.</p>

    <p>You may need to:</p>

    <div class="list-section">
        <ul>
            <li>stop drinking liquids hours before bed</li>
            <li>take magnesium at the same nightly time</li>
            <li>keep a consistent sleep schedule</li>
            <li>log the details for a while</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>It is annoying.<br>
    But waking up with chaos is worse.</p>

    <p><strong>This gave me my life back. I wake up stable because my timing is stable.</strong></p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>What to Expect From the Tool (Roughly 80 out of 100 should get some real quality of life improvement,
and about 50 out of 100 should at least feel “this finally explains my gut.”</h2>

    <p>It gives you a score.<br>
    Over time, you will see how your nights shape your mornings.</p>

    <p><strong>For me:</strong></p>

    <p><em>this turned years of unpredictable hell into something I could actually manage.</em></p>

    <p>No guarantees, but if you are dealing with hypersensitivity or IBS unpredictability, this gives you a real pattern to test instead of endless guessing.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Can evening timing really affect IBS mornings?</h3>
    <p>For some people, yes. If you have visceral hypersensitivity or vagus nerve dysregulation, the timing of fluids, magnesium, sugar, and sleep can matter more than the specific foods you eat that day.</p>

    <h3>Does this replace a low FODMAP or elimination diet?</h3>
    <p>No. This timing approach does not replace medical care or dietary work. It is meant for people who still have unpredictable mornings even after trying food changes, or for people who feel that timing matters but cannot see the pattern.</p>

    <h3>How long does it take to see a pattern?</h3>
    <p>Most people need at least two to four weeks of consistent timing before the trend becomes clear. The vagus nerve responds to repetition and rhythm, not quick hacks.</p>

    <h3>Is this medical advice?</h3>
    <p>No. This is one person's pattern and experiment, shared so others can test their own timing in an organized way. Always work with a medical professional for diagnosis and treatment decisions.</p>
