                <div class="label">What this is</div>
                <p>
                    A simple calculator that turns your evening timing 
                    into a single Morning Stability Score from 0 to 100.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <div class="label">What this is not</div>

    <h2>Who this is for</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your IBS or visceral hypersensitivity hits hardest in the morning.</li>
        <li>You have tried food elimination and low FODMAP, but mornings are still unpredictable.</li>
        <li>You notice that sleep, late liquids, or supplements change your gut, but you cannot see the pattern clearly.</li>
        <li>You are willing to keep your evening timing consistent for a few weeks to test a theory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The basic idea</h2>
    <p>
        For some people (including me), the main driver is not 
        <span class="emphasis">what</span> you eat, it is 
        <span class="emphasis">when</span> your system has to process water, magnesium, sugar, and meals
        relative to sleep and wake time.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have visceral hypersensitivity and a jumpy gut-brain loop, your nervous system cares a lot about rhythm, delay, and predictability. 
        When evenings are all over the place, mornings follow that same chaos.
    </p>

    <div class="section-box">
        <h3>The pattern I kept seeing</h3>
        <p>After tracking a lot of days, these four things mattered most for my mornings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When I stopped drinking liquids in the evening.</li>
            <li>When I took magnesium glycinate.</li>
            <li>When I actually fell asleep, not when I meant to.</li>
            <li>How long and how consistently I slept.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When those lined up in a stable window, my mornings were calmer and more predictable. 
            When they drifted or stacked badly, mornings got much worse.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>What the calculator actually does</h2>
    <p>The tool asks for a small set of inputs from the previous evening and night, then scores that day.</p>

    <div class="columns">
        <div class="col">
            <div class="label">Core timing inputs</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Dinner time and any late food or snacks.</li>
                <li>Last liquid time for the night.</li>
                <li>Magnesium glycinate timing and dose.</li>
                <li>Sleep start time and wake time.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <div class="label">Extra context</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Rough sugar load.</li>
                <li>Electrolyte use.</li>
                <li>Fiber, stress, and exercise level.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        It then gives a Morning Stability Score from 0 to 100 and lets you save the result locally in your browser 
        along with how your gut actually behaved the next morning.

    <h2>How to use it in real life</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pick a reasonable timing window for yourself (for example: last liquids by late evening, magnesium about 60 to 90 minutes before sleep, sleep within a consistent range, at least 7 hours in bed).</li>
        <li>Use the calculator each night or the following morning and log what actually happened the next day (urgency, pain, stool type, or just "good" vs "bad").</li>
        <li>Do this for at least 3 to 4 weeks before judging it. One random bad morning does not mean the pattern is wrong.</li>
        <li>Look for clusters. On higher scores, do your mornings tend to be calmer? On low scores, do you see more chaos?</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="note">
        The point is not to chase a perfect score. The point is to make the pattern visible enough that you are not guessing every single day.
    </p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2>What you can reasonably expect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You will see how sensitive your mornings are to late liquids, drifting magnesium timing, or inconsistent sleep.</li>
        <li>You may find there is a narrow timing window that gives you noticeably better mornings if you hold it steady.</li>
        <li>Even if your IBS does not vanish, you may feel less ambushed and more in control of the rhythm.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
        There are no guarantees. This is a model built by one person who has visceral hypersensitivity and got tired of random advice.
        If your nervous system behaves anything like mine, it may still be worth testing.
    </p>

    <h2>Quick FAQ</h2>

    <h3>Is this medical advice?</h3>
    <p>No. This is a personal tracking framework, not a treatment. Always work with a medical professional for diagnosis, medications, and health decisions.</p>

    <h3>Does this replace diet work?</h3>
    <p>No. Diet still matters. This is aimed at the group of people who have already tried diet changes and still wake up to chaos, or who feel timing is a missing piece.</p>

    <h3>Do you collect any of my data?</h3>
    <p>No. The calculator runs in your browser only. Your entries are stored locally in your own device storage. There are no accounts, no email, and no analytics.</p>

    <h3>How long should I try this?</h3>
    <p>
        Realistically, you need at least a few weeks of consistent timing to see a trend. 
        The nervous system learns through repetition, not single nights.
    </p>

        If any of this sounds like your mornings, you can try the timing model for yourself. 
        Worst case, you spent some time learning more about your own pattern. Best case, your mornings become less of a coin flip.
